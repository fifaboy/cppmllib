# A C++ Machine Learning Library
This is a C++ library of some machine learning algorithms. Algorithms included so far:
- Linear Regression (complete up to least square method)
- Correlation Coefficients (complete up to pearson, cos and my own)
- K-means Clustering (incomplete)

Probably the most common regression technique is *linear regression*. It has been a viable prediction method for a long time. If you are familiar with the general equation of a line *a**x* + *b**y* + *c* = 0, then you may have already guessed the idea behind it.

Consider a dataset (*X*, *Y*).
